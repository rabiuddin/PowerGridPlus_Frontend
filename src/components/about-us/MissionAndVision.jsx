                PowegridPlus OÃœ smartplug technology, is a software and hardware
                solution for electricity and GHG emmision management. Our
                AI-smartplug technology helps clients save on investment in
                remote electricity observation and control using elastic sensing
                technology and control scheme (i.e. Single submeter units per
                household/multiple devices). The solution provides automated
                energy audits for individual devices and generates realtime and
                suitable energy efficiency and CO2 advice to clients using
                artificial intelligence (AI). Some of the user interfaces
                adapted for the smartplug technology includes demand side
                recommendations services and chatbot technology. We equally
                utilize predictive and prescriptive analytics models to help
                clients generate energy efficiency and emmission advice at
                individual asset level.
