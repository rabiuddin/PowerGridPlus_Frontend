        Insert the AI smart plug into the power outlet to commence setup. The
        plugin sensor measurement specification for residential buildings
        accommodates a peak of 3kW load, 16Amps standard (or range between 15Amp
        to 20 Amp), 240Volts AC working voltage range, and 50-60 Hz
        configuration.
        <br />
        <br />
        Power on the smart plug using the “Push Button” on the AI smart plug.
        Setup routines follow a few easy steps that allow customers to connect
        the smart plug to a Wi-Fi network. The smart plug supports connection to
        a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. Following connection, customers select the AI
        mode that ensures they effortlessly add new appliances (for example,
        television, lamp, fridge, washing machine). Launch the PowergridPlus
        App, and iteratively plug in appliances until “New plug detected.” Tap
        the “New plug” icon, followed by the “+” icon to complete setup, then go
        to Step 3. This AI sensor sharing step gives the smart plug the ability
        to automatically and intelligently identify and track different loads.
        <br />
        <br />
        This compact design configuration allows clients to buy a single smart
        plug unit to sense all electrical loads and save costs on additional
        sensors while also having the benefits of real-time feedback on key
        loads, saving costs on smart plug technologies.

        Customers are required to download and register AI Smart plug apps every
        time they buy a new device. This Smart Plug includes a convenient energy
        and CO2 usage Dashboard and is compatible with the free accompanying web
        and mobile app. All information regarding your devices is transmitted to
        our online dashboard, where you can view reports on your energy
        consumption, electricity price tracking, and CO2 emissions, as well as
        manage the settings that control when your Smart plugs are turned on and
        off.
        <br />
        <br />
        The PowergridPlus app Dashboard incorporates advanced user interfaces
        such as demand-side recommendation services, conversational chatbot
        technology, and extended reality for providing real-time reports and
        insights into electricity consumption and CO2 emissions. These advanced
        user interfaces help improve user experience and engagement with the
        sensing-as-a-service (S2aaS) platform. This approach allows you to gain
        visibility into your energy consumption and easily identify the areas in
        your home that are causing energy waste or contributing to the biggest
        power bill every month.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our Smart Plug utilizes AI to automatically detect and generate
        recommendations that help eliminate minor power waste from your devices,
        helping to lower both your carbon emissions and electricity costs.
